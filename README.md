This project includes two main branches:

1. The code to run the arduino ADC/DAC (Written in C)
2. The code run on a raspberry pi to control the ADC/DAC (Written in Python)

A document containing the overview of the system can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZgvpLWs_gV8iS-O3V-WUd9L8gSJCAb6p24I1JG_nhCw/edit?usp=sharing). The document gives a system overview and
